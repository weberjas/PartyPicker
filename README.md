PartyPicker
===========

Abstract
--------
The Picker application is designed to facilitate users finding a fun activity. It allows them to choose from a list of different 
element which are part of activities which might interest them. The application will then display a list of activities which 
match the users' selections.


Purpose
-------
This application was originally created as part of my coursework for my computer science bachelor's degree. As such, many of 
the features of this application haven't been fully fleshed out. Over the next several weeks I'll be updating many of the pages 
and adding functionality. 


Future Plans
------------
In the future I plan to add maps, coupons, favorites and suggestions to the application.
